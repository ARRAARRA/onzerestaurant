    <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <p class="text"
            <p>Onze restaurant is highly reflective of todays everchanging New York City,
            as well as, the quickly changing borough of the Bronx. We are located
            convenieintly close to Manhattan in the loft district of SOBRO. As New
            York City is a bastion of change and culture, so is Onze restaurant.
            Our fresh organic cuisine naturally creates an intergral, and "must"
            fusion of the ingredients of the global cultural cusine of the Bronx.
            Onze originates with globally respected Bronx native Chef Manuel 
            Rodriguez, who is at the fore of the "neo global-fusion movement" 
            in cuisine. The experience of Onze restaurant spans the depths of Europe, Latin 
            America, India, West Africa, the Caribbean and beyond.  A visit to
            Onze restaurant is truly a visit to NYC, the Bronx, and the globe.
